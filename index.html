        <p>I'm Ray! Reading is my favourite hobby because it relaxes me, like I'm in a chill mode. I love reading Fantasy, Mystery, Adventure and Biographies. I love reading so much that my family is always says to stop reading. Reading helps open the mind to infinite possibilities.Research shows that regular reading: improves brain connectivity. increases your vocabulary and comprehension, empowers you to empathize with other people. Reading helps my spelling and vocabulary increase which helps with tests and school. This is why I love Reading!!</p>

        The sky was a kaleidoscope of colors as the sun shone brightly in the sky.The black and white,majestic mountain ranges were waves in a sea of freezing-cold snow. The peaks of the mountains were as spiky as a million knives poking out, like hands, reaching out for the sun. Green moss stuck on the rocks like glue. A lake of crystal-clear water flowed gently against the breeze down into an elegant waterfall to the remains below. A narrow path of sand slithered through the valley. The air was fresh and crisp, as snowy white birds tweeted and squawked, and swiftly glided over the mountains migrating to the other end of the world as summer was coming.</section>
